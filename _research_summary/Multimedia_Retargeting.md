introductions: 
  - 'In this research, we have studied different methods/optimization to solve multimedia retargeting problems from image/video to stereo images/video. The image is divided into either uniformed grids or irregular patches. For video resizing, we consider either in-between frame-coherence or continuous volumetric space coherence. In addition, we also consider summarizing objects (i.e. delete similar objects) to resize images. To determine similar objects’ importance, we measure and predict visual importance of similar objects. Recently, we also propose a deep learning strategy to handle image resizing.'
  - 'In total, our body of work on multimedia retargeting has been cited more than <span style="color:red">1400</span> times. Additionally, visual retargeting has since matured into a billion-dollar industry due to the explosion of different media formats and device capabilities. This multimedia retargeting work has made a clear mark in this segment of industry, as can be evidenced from our <span style="color:red">US Provisional Patent Application No. 61/334,953, that was licensed to Walt Disney for video cropping, temporally-coherent warping and retargeting.</span>'
